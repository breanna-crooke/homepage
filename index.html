<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Breanna Crooke, but most of the time I just go by Bre. I'm nineteen years old, and I was born April 9th, 2006. I am from Hamilton, Ohio. And I graduated from Hamitlon High School in May of 2024. &#127891</p>

<h3>Extracurriculars in School</h3>
<p>Ever since I was around four years old, I had been playing soccer, and I played soccer all the way up until I graduated high school. I have always had a love for soccer and I would love to continue playing in the future, even if it's not competitive, and just for fun. Also, starting in 7th grade, I joined show choir for my school. I did that as well as soocer for 6 years, again all the way up until graduation. </p>

<h3>Hobbies and Extras</h3>
<p>Along with soccer and show choir, i love to read. My favorite type of books are romance books! Music is also a very big part of who I am. I love listening to msuic all the time, and I <strong>love</strong> going to concerts for my favorite artists. &#127925 I try and go to as many concerts as I can. I currently work at Skyline Chili as a server,a location in Ross, Ohio. But, before that I worked at the Texas Roadhouse in hamilton, Ohio in the TOGO area. </p>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<p>I also consider myslef a very family and friend orientated person. My family is some of my favorite people and I love spending time with them, even if we are just sitting at home watching tv together. In my imediate family I have my older sister, and my mom and dad, along with the favorite in the house who is the dog, Ollie. And in the times i'm not with my family, or rarely by myself, I am out hanging out with my friends. My best friends are the ones I met through show choir.</p>


<p>This wraps up me, Bre, as a person, and I would love to get to know you! &hearts;</p>
